# v71 Release Notes and Upgrade Guide


## Upgrading

### From All-In-One or Standalone UnityPackage
If coming from the Unity All-In-One or standalone Voice SDK .unitypackage file ensure all code is removed that previously existed at: Assets/Oculus/Voice.  Samples are now added directly from the UPM interface instead of viewable within the package itself.

### From UPM
In order to upgrade or downgrade via UPM, simply select the desired version from the Unity Package Manager.  It is always safest to delete all generated sample directories on upgrade or downgrade in order to ensure they are compatible with the current version of the Voice SDK.
