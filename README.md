# JointLab
Unity3D-based immersive platform for controlling ABB IRB 120 robots in VR using Meta Quest 3, designed to teach robotics through spatial interaction, joint control, and live feedback.
JointLab is a Unity3D-based educational tool developed as part of a Master's thesis at Carnegie Mellon University. It allows students to control ABB industrial robots in a fully virtual replica of CMU's dFab Lab using the Meta Quest 3. The system uses real-time, bidirectional communication via ABB RobotStudio's Robot Web Services (RWS) and Externally Guided Motion (EGM) protocols.

This repository includes:

Unity project files and C# scripts
Packaged RobotStudio environment with RAPID scripts

JointLab is intended for educational institutions, robotics labs, and design programs seeking accessible and immersive robotic training tools.
